firebase-work-queue-advanced
============================

This repository is a fork of [firebase-work-queue - A Simple Firebase Queue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-work-queue). It adds some additional features including createdAt timestamps, event queue data persistance in the event of a worker crash, the ability to add an error callback to the worker process, and keeping track of queue item statuses.

This is an example of processing data using Firebase as a queuing system.

To run, first you'll need to install the Firebase node package:
    
    npm install firebase

To process elements in the work queue, start a worker like this:

    node worker.js

To add new elements to the work queue, start the generator, like this:
    
    node generator.js

You can start as many workers or generators as you like. The WorkQueue uses transactions to ensure that each job is only given to one worker.

Firebase has since released a work queue script that is much more advanced than their previous one and this one. I urge everyone to use that one instead: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-queue
